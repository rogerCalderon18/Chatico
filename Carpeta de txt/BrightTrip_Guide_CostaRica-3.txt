Intermediate Area

Small Tribes

Costa Rica is part of what’s known
as the “intermediate area” between
two important cultural regions: the
Mesoamerican cultural region and the
Andean cultural region.

Costa Rica was never home to any major
ancient civilizations such as the Mayas or the
Incas, instead, it was sparsely populated with
small tribes of people.

Petrospheres

Colonization

Rich Coast

One of these tribes most mysterious
contributions to history is hundreds of
perfectly round stone petrospheres.

The Spanish began their colonization of Costa
Rica in 1502 when Christopher Columbus
arrived at the Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica
during his fourth voyage to the Americas.

Costa Rica, which means “rich coast” in
English, was created by the Spanish, as they
expected to find a large quantity of gold here.

Independence

Battle of Rivas

National Hero

Costa Rica remained a Spanish colony
for more than 300 years and gained
independence in 1838.

An American Lawyer, William Walker, funded
a private army to conquer parts of Latin
America and tried to invade Costa Rica but
was defeated at the Battle of Rivas.

Juan Santamaría set fire to a barrack where
Walker’s soldiers were staying, ultimately
weakening his army and causing them to
retreat. He is now honored as Costa Rica’s
national hero.

Democracy

Civil War

Civil War

Costa Rica officially adopted a democracy
in 1869.

Costa Rica’s bloodiest conflict was
the Civil War that took place in
1948 due to disputed results from a
presidential election.

After the Civil War a new constitution was
drafted which guaranteed free elections,
voting rights for women and afro-Costa
Ricans and the abolition of the army.

Costa Rica Today

x

Costa Rica’s government is considered a “‘Democratic, free and
independent republic” .

x

Instead of an army, they have a national police force called the
Fuerza Publica which is in charge of domestic ground security.

x

Costa Rica has one of the most progressive healthcare systems in
the world, universal healthcare is provided to all citizens.

x

In January of 2018, the court issued a mandate requiring that
member countries require the legalization of same sex marriage.
Costa Rica was given 18 months to reform their laws, meaning that
marriage equality is guaranteed as of May 26, 2020.

x

There is a large and very active LGBTQ+ community in Costa Rica,
centered mainly in San José and Manuel Antonio.

Keel-billed Toucan

Pura Vida
It is a uniquely Costa Rican phrase which
literally translates to "pure life".
Could be used as a greeting or farewell, to say
thank you or your welcome, as an expression,
and in many other situations.
It’s a phrase that encompasses how Ticos like
to live their lives - simply, relaxed, stress free
and positive.

Costa Rica’s Natural Environments

Tropical Dry forest

Alpine tundra

Subalpine rain paramo

Rainforest

Why is Costa Rica so Biodiverse?
Mangrove forest
Costa Rica actually sits on the border of four very active tectonic plates,
the Cocos Plate, Caribbean Plate, South American Plate and Nazca
plate. The constant shifting and colliding of these plates formed Costa
Rica’s mountains and volcanoes. It also has created a large change
in elevation in a rather small land area. This steep elevation, coupled
with the fact that Central America is situated very close to the Equator,
created the perfect breeding ground for a wide array of biodiversity.

Costa Rica is about the size of the US
state of West Virginia, which has just one
biome, compared to the 12 in Costa Rica .
Although Costa Rica takes up approximately
⅓ of a percent of the globe’s landmass,
it’s estimated that it contains roughly 4%
of the world’s species. Roughly 27% of the
country’s territory is considered protected by
the government.

Cloud forest

Over the past few decades, Costa Rica has
invested significantly in renewable resources,
and more than 95% of all of the energy
the country produces comes from these
sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and
hydroelectric energy.

[5]

Many credit Costa Rica with creating the idea
of ecotourism, or tourism directed towards
supporting exotic or threatened environments.
It’s estimated that almost 80% of tourists who
come to the country support ecotourism in
one way or another.

Surfing

Toucan

x

Playa Hermosa, just south of Jacó, is the heart of surfing
culture on the Pacific coast and has hosted international
surf competitions for many years.

x

If you are an experienced surfer, Playa Hermosa is for you.

x

If you are a beginner, consider beaches such as Jacó or
Manuel Antonio since the tide is usually more calm.

Wildlife
x

Visiting this region will also allow you to experience
tropical wildlife while at the beach.

x

Manuel Antonio is home to a national park where, after a
short hike you will be on a beach where you will see lots
of monkeys!

x

The entire coast is home to wildlife such as scarlet
macaws, toucans, hummingbirds, iguanas and
even crocodiles.

Weather

Central Pacific Coast
The Central Pacific Coast is Costa Rica’s most visited region.
It’s home to some of the most popular beach towns for both local and
foreign visitors. Ideal place to visit if you aren’t spending a lot of time
in the country.

Popular towns
x

Jacó (1.5 hours from San José)

x

Manuel Antonio (2.5 Hours from San José)

x

Uvita (3 hours from San José)

x

Rain is a daily occurrence both on the beach and inland
during the rainy season (May - mid-November) and less
so in the dry season (mid-November - April).

x

During the rainy season it’s hot and sunny in the
mornings, with a predictable rainstorm around 1pm which
could last for an hour or the rest of the day.

x

It’s almost always dry in the mornings, allowing you to
plan your day around the rain.

x

During the dry season, rainstorms happen during the
afternoon, but are much less frequent.

Waterfalls
There are several waterfalls along the coast which make for a
great day trip. Nauyaca Falls is the most impressive, but you
can easily find them around Manuel Antonio and Uvita.

The beach towns here are easy to navigate. you will have a wide
variety of restaurants, hotels, and activities to choose from. Large
numbers of tourists visit these towns each year, meaning you will
almost always deal with crowds.

Nauyaca Falls

If you go a little further south towns such as Dominical and Uvita are
less developed and have significantly fewer tourists. These towns
are still very accessible and easy to navigate for foreigners, however
there is a smaller variety of hotels and restaurants to choose from
when planning your trip.

Looking to escape the crowds?
If you have a rental car you can easily go to beaches such as
Esterillos, Bejuco or Matapalo.

Tamarindo Beach

Samara Beach

Guanacaste

Weather
x

Guanacaste has some of the driest and most
predictable weather in the country, making it a great
place to visit year round.

x

The region is technically considered dry tropical
forest, meaning it’s not as green or lush as the Central
Pacific Coast.

x

As you travel farther south down the peninsula, you
can expect more rain and lush vegetation similar to
the Central Pacific Coast.

x

Guanacaste is home to most of Costa Rica’s all
inclusive beach resorts.

x

Similar to the Central Pacific Coast, it’s easy to road
trip from beach to beach here. Since there are more
beaches, it’s something you can do for several days.
Make sure to rent a SUV with 4WD if you plan on
doing this.

Guanacaste is home to the beach-dense Nicoya Peninsula.
The whole region has the highest concentration of beaches in the
country with more than 300 along the coastline. This region is home
to Costa Rica’s second international airport, which is right here near
the city of Liberia, the capital of Guanacaste Province. If you plan
on spending your time here, it’s best to fly into Liberia. From Liberia
airport you can be at a great beach like Playa Hermosa in as little as
30 minutes.

Beach Destinations
x

Tamarindo beach is 1.5 hours away

x

Sámara is 2 hours

x

Montezuma is just under 4 hours away.

The few main highways leaving Liberia are paved, but most roads
that connect beach towns are gravel roads making travel times
slower the farther south you travel.

National Parks

[8]

x

Rincón de la Vieja National Park is the most popular,
which is known for its hiking and boiling pools of mud.

x

Llanos de Cortéz is one of the most impressive
waterfalls in the area and is worth a day trip.

Come here if…
You are looking for adventure and a biologically intense
experience complete with jungle trekking and whale watching.
Experienced travelers would do well here, patience and
flexibility are qualities you should possess when visiting.

Osa Peninsula
Most of the Osa Peninsula is protected land and is considered
the most biologically intense place in the country.

x

Puerto Jiménez is the biggest town on the peninsula, and
offers the peninsula’s only real tourism infrastructure.

x

Corcovado National Park
ā

ā

This park offers some of the best bird watching and
wildlife observation in the country.
You will need to organize a tour within the park, as
infrastructure within the park is very limited and it’s quite
easy to get lost in the jungle.

ā

Tree Fro
g

It’s unlike any other jungle experience out there and is
highly recommended if you are looking for a rustic jungle
experience.

This area of the country is also one of the
wettest, meaning that forests here are lush,
humid and dense. This is an important reason
why the area is so biodiverse.

Whale and dolphin watching are also popular
here when humpback whales migrate through
the waters off the coast from lage July to
November and December through March.

[9]

The peninsula also offers some spectacular
tropical beaches almost devoid of crowds.
Beaches south of Puerto Jimenez and around
Bahia Drake are some of the most stunning
and remote in the country.

Rica’s tallest mountain, which you can summit with a guide in
just two days.

Costa Rica •

The Caribbean Coast
The Caribbean coast of the country is different from other regions in
Costa Rica both ecologically and culturally.
The Caribbean coast has a unique history compared to the rest of the
country which began in the 1870s.
At this time in history, the Costa Rican government was constructing a
railway. Due to a labor shortage at that time, construction companies
brought in thousands of foreign workers, mostly from mostly Jamaica,
to help with construction. Afro-caribbean migrant workers suffered
from harsh segregation laws during this time, and up until 1945 people
of African descent were only allowed to live in Limón province. During
this time, a new creole language developed in Limón which fused
Jamacian Creole with Spanish. Limonese Creole, a regional language is
still widely spoken today by more than 60,000 people. The language is
often called “Mekatelyu” which comes from the words “make I tell you”

Tortuguero
Up here you have a national park called “Tortuguero”.
Accessing Tortuguero in the north is a bit more tricky, as there is no
terrestrial transportation to get you to town, which is situated along a
series of canals surrounded by mangrove forests.

which in standard English would be “let me tell you.” If you travel to the
Caribbean, you will likely hear Limonese Creole being spoken by locals.

Language, foo

West Indian
culture
are part of
wha
makes Limon t
so unique
compared to
the rest of
the country.

x

The easiest way to get here is to take a half hour domestic flight
from San José to Tortuguero.

x

Your other option is taking a shuttle or public bus to Pavona, then
taking a boat to Tortuguero. There are no cars in Tortuguero, so
don’t rent a car if you plan on coming here.

Most visitors who come to Costa Rica visit either the northern or
southern coast, the city of Puerto Limón in the center of the province is
an industrial port city that most tourists just pass through.

Weather
Most of Limón province consists of tropical forest and flat
coastal lowlands that are wet most of the year.

Beaches
The southern beaches surrounding Puerto Viejo are much
less developed than beaches in Guanacaste or the Central
Pacific, but they have their own unique charm.
Reggae music, jerk chicken, beach cruiser bicycles and
beautiful beaches make this part of the country a hidden gem
for tourists. It has a unique vibe unlike any other beaches in
the country.

How to Travel Here
x

In order to get here, you’ll need to fly into San José.

x

There is just one main highway that connects the coast with San
Jose, Ruta 32.
ā

Come here if…
You are looking to experience laid back caribbean vibes,
distinct food, and afro caribbean culture.

It’s one of the most spectacular drives in all of Costa Rica which
cuts through primary forest as you descend into the caribbean
lowlands. To get from the San José airport to the southern
beaches of Puerto Viejo, it will take you about 4 hours.

Head specifically to Tortugero National Park if you are
interested in sea turtles and navigating dense mangrove
forests through tropical canals.

Getting Around the Country

Tips

Renting a Car

Laugh

Pros
̰

̰

̰

̰

Frown

1.

Driving laws are similar to those in the USA, you can
generally expect to abide by the same rules
and regulations.

2.

You must drive with your driver’s license AND
passport, so make sure you keep it on you
when driving.

3.

If you are traveling off any main highways to more
isolated locations, it’s always a good idea to ask about
the road conditions before you leave.

4.

We recommend renting a car with 4WD - this will allow
you to go almost anywhere.

5.

Make sure to have some local currency on hand for
tolls when leaving San Jose, cards are not accepted at
toll booths.

Renting a car allows you the freedom to easily go
wherever, whenever.
It’s comfortable and allows you to go “off the
beaten path.”
If you are traveling in a small group, this is a great
option to consider, as it may be cheaper than paying for
transportation individually.
This is also a great option for families with kids.

Cons
̰

̰

̰

a.

Driving in Costa Rica can be tough, especially in the city.
Ticos are defensive drivers and regulations aren’t widely
enforced meaning people tend to follow their own rules
on the road.

6.

Google Maps works really well in Costa Rica and
can help you navigate to almost any destination
in the country.

7.

A “Guachimán” is someone who watches over your car.
Typically, they wear some sort of reflective vest and will
approach your car with a smile and help you park your
car by signaling when to pull forward, stop and reverse.

If you are staying in San José reconsider a rental car,
traffic can be a nightmare.
Renting a car is slightly cheaper than renting a car in the
US, however it’s not the cheapest way to get around
the country.

Most rental companies will give you the option to
rent a “Quick Pass” for a surcharge, meaning you
won’t need to have cash on hand for tolls. You will
be billed for your tolls when returning the car.

a.

It’s best to give them whatever loose change you
have in the car or 1,000 colones.

Don’t rent a car if…
̰

Driving times

̰

Driving times on Google Maps are pretty accurate, however it’s smart to add at least 45
minutes to those times to account for heavy rain or traffic, even outside San José.
̰

Driving times from San José

Driving times from Liberia

San José - Jacó (2.5 hours)

Liberia - Tamarindo (1.5 hours)

San José - Manuel Antonio (3.5 hours)

Liberia - Santa Teresa (4.5 hours)

San José - Puerto Viejo (4 hours)

Liberia - Monteverde (2 hours)

San José - La Fortuna (3 hrs)

Liberia - La Fortuna (2.5 hours)

San Jose - Monteverde (3 hours)

̰

[ 15 ]

You are headed to Puerto Jiménez in Osa,
most roads are not paved and can be hard
to navigate.
Traveling to the southern part of
Guanacaste, roads here are also not
paved, which translates to slow driving
times. SUVs and 4x4 are recommended if
you are traveling here.

You should consider renting a car if…
̰

San Jose - Tamarindo (4.5 hours)

You plan on going to Tortugero, as there
are no roads that lead there.

You are going to more than two
destinations while in the country.
If you are only visiting one or two
destinations, it’s probably more
economical to use a shuttle service.

flying domestically. Costa Rica is well connected for such a small
country, and most major tourist destinations are serviced by two
commercial airlines, Sansa and Skyway.
Tickets usually cost between $70 and $150 each way and flights usually
take between 30 - 45 minutes.

Shuttles
If you’re not keen on driving, but would prefer a direct and comfortable
way to travel, consider using private shuttles.

Ƈ

Ƈ

Interbus is the most well known shuttle company, and you book
online just like a flight.
They will pick you up and drop you off directly at your hotel in a 10
passenger air conditioned van, which is very convenient.

Public transportation

If you are staying at an Airbnb, you will have to get yourself to a

Costa Rica has a very reliable network of inter-city public busses

hotel where they do pickups close to you, which should be a quick
Uber/taxi ride.
Prices are between $50 and $100 each way and they travel to
almost every popular tourist destination around the country.

Ƈ

You can book just a few days in advance, although during the high
season (Jan - May) we suggest booking a week or so ahead of time.

Tour operator

Ƈ

There are a large network of tour operators out there that can design
an itinerary based on exactly what you want to do. The great part about
this is that they worry about getting you from point A to B, taking out all
the transportation hassle and guesswork out of the equation. This tends
to be pricey, but depending on the company they can coordinate just
transportation or your entire vacation. You should choose this option if
you want to come to Costa Rica, but don’t want to plan any of
the logistics.

Unlike most of Central America, busses in Costa Rica aren’t
“chicken buses.” Most are similar to greyhound busses you see in
the US but may not have AC.
Traveling in public buses is surprisingly comfortable.
Directo means direct, and these busses make just one stop so
passengers can buy a snack and use the restroom.
Colectivos, or “collective” busses stop at several towns along the
way to pick up additional passengers. If possible, it’s worth the extra
money to take a direct bus as this will save you time.

Getting your bus ticket
Ƈ

Ƈ

Ƈ

Ƈ

Taking the bus is pretty straightforward. You will need to purchase a
ticket at the bus station.
You can also purchase a few days beforehand - so if you know your
itinerary you can purchase a to and from ticket at the same time.
There are more than 15 terminals where busses leave from San
José, meaning it’s important to know which terminal you are going
to. Typically they are arranged by location (example: Terminal del
caribe - busses traveling to Limón).
Even if you don’t speak Spanish, you can use the bus guide
provided by the ICT, figure out where your bus leaves from and
take an Uber to the terminal.

Choosing a Beach
Central Pacific Coast Beaches
Jacó
x

Synonymous with partying, surfing and nightlife.

x

It’s not secluded by any means, and is a popular destination
year round.

x

The main strip is full of restaurants, bars, clubs and even a casino.

x

Come here if you are looking to surf and party, don’t come here if
you are looking for a secluded beach getaway.

Manuel Antonio
x

Home to Costa Rica’s most visited National Park.

x

The public beach and the beaches within the national park are
beautiful - smooth brown sand, palm trees, and relatively calm

Jaco Beach

water perfect for swimming make it an ideal vacation spot for any
beach goer.
x

This beach is teeming with tourists almost year round.

x

The narrow 7km road which takes you from Quepos to Manuel
Antonio is saturated with hotels and restaurants, and it’s very clear
that this town is built to receive large numbers of tourists.

x

If you don’t mind crowds and want to spend time relaxing at the
beach and eating well, come here. It still doesn’t offer a secluded
beach feeling, but it definitely is beautiful and worth a visit.

Dominical
x

It’s about an hour south of Manuel Antonio.

x

The small and quiet beach town sits at the mouth of the Barú River,
and the beach itself is rocky and lined with palm trees.

x

It’s not a great beach to come to if you are looking to relax on a
sandy, comfortable beach, however it’s beautiful and has
killer sunsets.

x

The town has a relaxed, laid back vibe and has just a fraction of the
amount of tourists that Manuel Antonio does.

x

It tends to shut down pretty early, and with just a handful of
restaurants and hotels, there really isn’t much to do besides relaxing
and surfing.

x

Come here if you are looking to unplug, avoid crowds and
experience a small, slow moving beach town.

Uvita
x

This town is larger and more spread out than Dominical, but it’s still
much smaller than Manuel Antonio.

x

The beaches within the Bahía Ballena National Park are beautiful,
have soft sand perfect for relaxing and during low tide form a
whale’s tale visible from above.

x

The beach is almost never crowded and is within a national park,
meaning it has a very secluded feeling.

x

The town is more spread out but still tiny, with dirt roads making it a
great place for renting bicycles. It has a small town feel and more of
a tourist infrastructure, meaning there are more restaurant and hotel
options than Dominical.

Osa Peninsula Beaches
x

Beaches south of Puerto Jimenez all are very secluded and don’t
really have any services.

x

Think dirt roads leading to a parking lot right next to the beach.
This is a perfect place to come if you are looking for virgin beaches
devoid of tourists.

x

When you think of a tropical paradise on a deserted island, these
are the beaches that will come to your mind.

x

Come here to spend the afternoon relaxing, but with little to no
services available along these beaches you’ll need to have a car and
bring food and water for the day.

Guanacaste beaches
Tamarindo
x

Has a small beach-town feeling and a pretty developed tourism
infrastructure.

x

The beach here is beautiful - soft tan sand, calm waters and just a
handful of restaurants and hotels that line the beach.

x

Tamarindo has some of the best sunsets Costa Rica has to offer.

x

A lot of tourists come here, so prepare yourself for that, however
the crowds are less intense than they are in Manuel Antonio.

x

The town itself has a lot of restaurants, bars and good nightlife, so
this is a great place to come if you are looking to relax on a beautiful
beach by day and experience decent nightlife.

Caribbean Coast beaches
Nosara
x

The three beaches bordering the town of Nosara - Playa Nosara,
Playa Pelada and Playa Guiones are all beautiful and feel much
more secluded than Tamarindo.

x

Think tan-sand natural beaches divided by rocky outcrops with
palm trees and surfers.

x

Nosara is heavily forested and most roads aren’t paved, meaning
after a long day at the beach you head back to your hotel in the
jungle.

x

It attracts a lot of surfers, is slow moving, relaxed and has a
surprising amount of small, trendy restaurants. It’s a great place to
come if you want to relax at the beach, eat well and disconnect.

Puerto Viejo de Talamanca
x

Dirt roads, beach cruiser bikes and dense jungle create an
environment where time stands still and you can really focus on
relaxing.

x

Beaches have soft sand all around and are great to soak up the sun
and relax.

x

Come here if you are searching for a uniquely Caribbean vibe
nestled within the jungle.

Tortuguero

Montezuma

x

Like most beaches along the Northern Caribbean coast, Tortuguero
is nestled next to dense mangrove forests and canals.

x

Waves along these mostly black-sand beaches are particularly
strong and don’t make for great surfing or swimming.

x

Three species of sea turtles nest along these beaches most of
the year, so accessing beaches at nighttime (when turtles nest) is
prohibited unless you are part of an organized tour.

x

Montezuma has an off the beaten bath feel.

x

It’s a small town accessed by bumpy dirt roads, meaning it’s less
crowded than most beaches on the Nicoya Peninsula.

x

The beaches are beautiful - great for relaxing and surfing - and are
located next to a pretty impressive waterfall and nature reserve.

x

x

The town attracts a lot of backpackers and surfers and has a good
variety of international food to try.

During the day however it’s a nice place to relax and really feels like
you are in the jungle.

x

Think of coming to Tortuguero as more of a jungle experience with
the added plus of having access to the beach.

x

This is a great place to head if you want to combine both jungle and
beach and are looking for a more bohemian vibe.

Jungle and Mountains

La Fortuna
Home to Costa Rica’s most famous volcano, Volcán Arenal.
One of the most popular things to do in La Fortuna is to visit hot
springs.

Cloud Forest
A Cloud forest, also called montane rain forest, includes vegetation of
tropical mountainous regions in which the rainfall is often heavy and
persistent.
Condensation occurs because of cooling of moisture-laden air currents
deflected upward by the mountains. The trees in the cloud forests are
typically short and crooked. Essentially, it’s a tropical forest inside a
cloud.

Monteverde
A small mountain town that sits right next to Reserva Santa Elena. One
of Costa Rica’s largest cloud forest reserves. The town itself is small,
quaint and geared to tourists who come specifically to experience the
forest first hand.

x

There is a high concentration of hot springs in the area which
are naturally heated by the geothermal energy generated by the
volcano.

x

There are a handful of options when it comes to choosing your ideal
hot springs

x

Baldí Hot Springs is great for families with things like waterslides
and play areas.

x

Tabacón Hot Springs is great for adults and hone in on the relaxing
and beauty aspects of a hot spring experience.

x

La Fortuna is also home to a quite impressive and accessible
waterfall called Catarata La Fortuna.

x

In addition to hot springs and waterfalls, you can book a wide
variety of adventure activities such as hiking Cerro Chato below the
base of Volcán Arenal.

There are several ways you can experience the cloud forest, such as
guided hikes during the day or night, or walking through hanging
bridges built throughout the canopy.

x

Hikes through the forest can be done either on your own or
accompanied by a naturalist guide. If you want to hire a guide, it’s best
to do so a day in advance. Your hotel or hostel will have guides that they
work with, or you can alternately visit one of several travel agencies that
are downtown to arrange a tour.

Lake Arenal is just a stone’s throw away from La Fortuna, and offers
paddle boarding, kayaking and other lake activities.

Río Pacuare
One of Costa Rica’s hidden gems located in central Costa Rica just
before the caribbean lowlands. This area of the country is home to rich
primary forest, and rafting down the Río Pacuare is one of the most
unique and exciting ways to experience Costa Rica’s biodiversity.

Zip Lining
The most exciting way to experience the cloud forest in Monteverde
is to harness up and zip line through the canopy. Costa Rica is world
famous for its zipline in Monteverde, it’s actually been voted one of the
top adventure activities to do in all of Latin America. You literally zoom
through the canopy on a series of more than a dozen cables.

While rafting down the river, you will see primary forest and the region’s
unique flora and fauna. This is a great way to learn about Costa Rica’s
very small indigenous population first hand.
Regardless of whether or not you chose a luxury like Rio Pacuare
Lodge, or more affordable options like Exploradores Outdoors, rafting
the river is the same. If you have time, we highly recommend doing an
overnight rafting tour.
